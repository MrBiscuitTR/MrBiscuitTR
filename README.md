# Hi, I'm Cagan! 👋
A tech enthusiast and CS student at Université Paris-Saclay. trying to adapt to an ever-changing world of technology with a focus on practical, innovative solutions. Originally from Istanbul, I blend curiosity with hands-on building to tackle real-world challenges.

## What I'm Up To Now 🚀
- **Applied AI & Privacy-Focused Agents**: Building secure, local AI tools like my pinned project P.O.T.A.T.O. – a versatile voice assistant that prioritizes privacy.
- **Automation Tools**: Loving n8n for creating efficient, custom workflows that run locally and keep data under control.
- **OS & Low-Level Exploration**: Deep into Linux (big fan, not so much Windows), tinkering with operating systems and getting my hands dirty with low-level programming.

## My Background 🛠️
Coming from a solid foundation in full-stack web dev – think React with TypeScript, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on the front, Python backends, and database wrangling. I've dabbled in cybersecurity (Kali Linux adventures), game development, and a ton of Python scripting. Recent projects include TwoPlace (secure video calls), ConsultED (AI-powered uni consulting), and Listify (smart Spotify playlist organizer).

## Education 📚
- Currently studying Math-Info (Mathematics & Computer Science) at Université Paris-Saclay
- Graduated from Istanbul Saint-Joseph French High School

## Active Focus
I am currently focused on my latest large project, P.O.T.A.T.O, which is a private, local, and multi-purpose AI tool operatign agent, that is vocal, graphic, and anything else you need it to be. Under active develoment and not currenly ready for public use, but I give you my word it is amazing.
