# Hi, I'm Cagan! 👋
A tech enthusiast and CS student at Université Paris-Saclay. trying to adapt to an ever-changing world of technology with a focus on practical, innovative solutions. Originally from Istanbul, I blend curiosity with hands-on building to tackle real-world challenges.

## What I'm Up To Now 🚀
- **Applied AI & Privacy-Focused Agents**: Building secure, local AI tools like my pinned project P.O.T.A.T.O. – a versatile voice assistant that prioritizes privacy.
- **Automation Tools**: Loving n8n for creating efficient, custom workflows that run locally and keep data under control.
- **OS & Low-Level Exploration**: Deep into Linux (big fan, not so much Windows), tinkering with operating systems and getting my hands dirty with low-level programming.

## My Background 🛠️
Coming from a solid foundation in full-stack web dev – think React with TypeScript, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on the front, Python backends, and database wrangling. I've dabbled in cybersecurity (Kali Linux adventures), game development, and a ton of Python scripting. Recent projects include TwoPlace (secure video calls), ConsultED (AI-powered uni consulting), and Listify (smart Spotify playlist organizer).

## Education 📚
- Currently studying Math-Info (Mathematics & Computer Science) at Université Paris-Saclay
- Graduated from Istanbul Saint-Joseph French High School

## Active Focus
I am currently focused on my latest large project: P.O.T.A.T.O (Practical Omnipurpose Technical AI Tool Operator) — a modular, locally-run voice AI assistant emphasizing strong privacy and security. It supports multimodal inputs (voice, images, code, PDFs, folders), integrates SearX for web search, offers optional TOR routing, and runs efficiently on high-end hardware (24+ GB VRAM recommended). Designed for extensibility, the project is under active, ongoing development. it is a multi-purpose agent that comes with a web GUI, and has enhanced capabilities, all configurable by editing a file, or using the gui. The code has no built-in telemetry and focuses on privacy, but it is very hard to guarantee data privacy for the python modules or other software used within the code. Offline mode is fully supported, but expect some tools (Web related ones and all other online tools) to be disabled, and reduced quality as well as capabilities.
